# TimeLogCalculator
Daily Log Time Calculator

This is currently designed based off our remote work format. 

Future Versions (yet to come):

I would like to change this to be a table where you can select which type of item you are adding, break, lunch etc. Logon and Logoff can still be static fields.

I would like to write the results to file with a button when the day is complete. (maybe allow this to open and close throughout the day whenever you take a break)

Future Future Versions (who knows when):

Write this file out to a database, potentially tracked by user.
Be able to report and provide analysis on the timesheets.
